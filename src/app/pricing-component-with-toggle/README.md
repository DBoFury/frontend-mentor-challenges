## My process

The main challenge I faced was managing the background images. Initially, I attempted to use a fixed position for them, but this caused the image to scroll along with the entire page. On the other hand, using absolute positioning resulted in overflow, which I resolved by adding a relative position to a parent div and clipping the excess.
