## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vite
- TS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I have made extensive use of Semantic HTML 5 markup to ensure proper structuring and meaningful elements. Additionally, I have implemented a responsive NavBar that offers enhanced functionality and includes animations specifically designed for mobile devices. Although I have made progress in working with SVG files, handling them in conjunction with Vite is an aspect that I am still in the process of fully comprehending.
