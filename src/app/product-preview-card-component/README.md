## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vite
- TS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

When styling your application, it is important to prioritize mobile users. In Tailwind CSS, it is recommended to write styles primarily for mobile users and then specify how to adjust the styles for desktop screens. Additionally, I learned how to incorporate custom styles and colors into Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

I still have much to learn about developing effective styling strategies for applications. However, using Tailwind CSS certainly makes the styling process more enjoyable compared to using plain CSS alone.
