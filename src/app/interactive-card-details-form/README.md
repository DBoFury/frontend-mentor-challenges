  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## Acknowledgments

Try creating a parent div in the middle of the front and back cards as that is the most useful approach. To move cards, use the transformation operator.
