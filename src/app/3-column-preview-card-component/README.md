## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vite
- TS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

During this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to use imported SVG icons as props and incorporate them as JSX elements within components. This allowed for greater flexibility and customization in designing user interfaces. Additionally, I honed my skills in utilizing TailwindCSS and adopting a mobile-first workflow, enabling me to create responsive and visually appealing designs.

### Continued development

As I continue to work with TailwindCSS, I find myself becoming more comfortable and confident in its usage. It has proven to be a powerful and invaluable tool for styling components, streamlining the design process, and achieving consistent and visually appealing results.
