### What I learned

In this project, I ventured into the realm of NextJS for the very first time. The primary motivation behind this choice is my intention to utilize NextJS in my upcoming personal endeavors. Embracing this technology early on proved to be an excellent practice, allowing me to grow more at ease with its functionalities.

One standout advantage of NextJS is its folder-based routing system, which offers exceptional organization capabilities. This feature enables me to manage all my projects cohesively within a single repository, streamlining the development process and promoting orderliness.
